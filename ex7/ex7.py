    This file contains code that helps you get started on the
    exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:

       pca.py
       project_data.py
       recover_data.py
       compute_centroids.py
       find_closest_centroids.py
       kmeans_init_centroids.py

    For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
    or any other files other than those mentioned above.

    ================= Part 1: Find Closest Centroids ====================
    To help you implement K-Means, we have divided the learning algorithm

    part, you shoudl complete the code in the find_closest_centroids function.
