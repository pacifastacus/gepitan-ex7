     ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
     Instructions: You should first compute the covariance matrix. Then, you
                   should use the "svd" function to compute the eigenvectors
                   and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. 
    
     Note: When computing the covariance matrix, remember to divide by m (the
           number of examples).
