    ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    Instructions: Go over every example, find its closest centroid, and store
                  the index inside idx at the appropriate location.

                  closest to example i. Hence, it should be a value in the 
                  range 1..K
    
    Note: You can use a for-loop over the examples to compute this.
    Note: For faster execution you should calculate distances exploiting numpy broadcast capability
